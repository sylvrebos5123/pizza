# pizza

1) In PHPMyAdmin :
Create a new database "pizza".
Copy/paste the content of sql/pizza.sql in the tab SQL and click on Execute

2) Check the file php/connect_db.php.
Sometimes the host can be "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost" and the password can be "root" in some cases (check your settings)

3) Place that folder where the local server was installed.
Normally you have a /localweb or /www folder to place the project in order to run PHP and display the result in your browser

Enjoy :)
